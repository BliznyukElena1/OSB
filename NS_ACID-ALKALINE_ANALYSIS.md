# UNIFIED ACID/ALKALINE ANALYSIS

to determine …  
 
-	ANAEROBIC/DYSAEROBIC IMBALANCE 
-	GLUCOGENIC/KETOGENIC IMBALANCE 
-	ACID/ALKALINE IMBALANCE 
 
 
## Analysis Instructions and Supplement Selection 
 
This Unified Acid/Alkaline Analysis is one of three Analyses that constitute your NUTRI-SPEC Metabolic Imbalance Analysis.  The other two Analyses are your Sympathetic/Parasympathetic Imbalance Analysis and your Electrolyte/Water Analysis.  The effective sequence for analyzing your patient’s test results is to do the three Analyses in order --- Unified Acid/Alkaline Analysis, followed by Electrolyte/Water Analysis, and then Sympathetic/ Parasympathetic Imbalance Analysis.  
 
You may perform this Analysis as a stand-alone procedure --- or --- integrate the findings as part of your Electrolyte/Water Analysis &/or your Sympathetic/Parasympathetic Analysis --- or --- do it as part of your comprehensive Metabolic Imbalance Testing.  
 
If you are doing the Unified Acid/Alkaline Analysis as part of comprehensive Metabolic Imbalance Testing, record your results on your Comprehensive TEST RESULTS FORM. If you are doing Unified Acid/Alkaline Analysis as a stand-alone, or, in conjunction with your Electrolyte/Water Analysis &/or your Sympathetic/Parasympathetic Imbalance Analysis, you may find it simpler to record your results on your MULTI-PURPOSE TEST RESULTS FORM. 
 
The only tests required for the Unified Acid/Alkaline Analysis are (noted by a on the Test Results Form) … 
 	 
-	Adjusted Urine pH 
-	Adjusted Urine Specific Gravity 
-	Adjusted Saliva pH 
-	Pa 
-	Respiratory Rate 
-	(Pa - P1) 
-	Breath Hold Time 
 
That is all you need to do! 
 
After obtaining the Adjusted UpH, SG, and SpH … 
 
With the patient sitting relaxed on the exam table, say, “Please, no talking  while I test --- it throws off the results.”  Count the Heart Rate for 15 seconds  and multiply by 4 (= accurate to ¼ cycle = 17 ¼ x 4 = 69).  That is your patient’s Pulse a (Pa).  Record Pa. 
 
Have the patient lie supine, and immediately after the patient is settled, count the Respiratory Rate for 30 seconds (= accurate to ¼ cycle) and multiply by 2. (Do not record the Respiratory Rate yet.) 
 
Immediately after completing the Respiratory Rate (i.e., exactly 30 seconds    after lying supine), count the Heart Rate for 15 seconds (= accurate to ¼ cycle) and multiply by 4.  This is Pulse 1 (P1).  Record the Respiratory Rate and P1.  Subtract and record (Pa – P1). 
 
If you are doing complete NUTRI-SPEC Metabolic Testing or Electrolyte/ 
Water Imbalance Analysis move on to your Blood Pressure & Heart Rate Orthostatic tests otherwise…  
 
Have the patient sit up.  Then, ask the patient to hold the breath as long as possible. Record the Breath Hold Time.  
 
SELECTING SUPPLEMENTS:  Every supplement your patient needs to address any of these three Imbalances is found in one block of the supplement selection table.  Match the row of your patient’s Adjusted Urine pH to the column of the Adjusted Saliva pH and there you are --- with a half dozen or so possible choices.  Select all choices that apply (and in some cases, none will apply).   
 
Of course, all your patients are also on Activator and the most appropriate Immuno-Synbiotic.  
 
IRON CLAD RULE THAT MUST NEVER BE IGNORED: If the supplement selections do not include either Oxy Tonic or Oxy D+, then your patient must immediately begin the BALANCING PROCEDURE to determine the ideal proportions of your Metabolic Sparks --- Oxy Tonic, Electro Tonic, and/or Oxy D+.  The BALANCING PROCEDURE is the only way to completely individualize that patient’s Metabolic Therapy.   
 
Remember, the Diphasic Nutrition Plan is the foundation of your LIVE STRONGER LONGER Metabolic Therapy.  Give all your patients their individualized age- and health-appropriate DNP.   
 
That is all you need to do! However, to make your Metabolic Therapy even more comprehensive you will add to this analysis of Anaerobic/Dysaerobic, Glucogenic/Ketogenic, and Acid/Alkaline Imbalances your Sympathetic/Parasympathetic Imbalance Support System Analysis.  
 
How much of each supplement selected by your Unified Acid/Alkaline Analysis do you recommend?  On your initial Testing, start small --- then consider increasing if the same supplements need shows up on a follow up testing.
